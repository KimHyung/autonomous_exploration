Changelog for package urg_node
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

0.1.15 (2020-10-27)
-------------------
* Function setSkip() set as void
  This function as no return type causing undefined behavior. This function
  has been declared as void.
* Contributors: bostoncleek

0.1.14 (2020-06-04)
-------------------
* Bumped CMake version.
* Removed trailing whitespace.
* Contributors: Tony Baltovski

0.1.13 (2020-03-27)
-------------------
* Revert "fix(updateStatus): Update status on diagnostics update"
* Contributors: Tony Baltovski

0.1.12 (2020-03-14)
-------------------
* Updated roslint to only check files in this repo.
* Updated TravisCI config.
* fix(updateStatus): Update status on diagnostics update
  Otherwise the diagnostics information does not really reflect the device
  status.
* synchronize_time: reset when clock is warped
  If either the hardware clock or system clock warp, reset the EMA to
  prevent incorrect clock values from being used. Detect the warp by
  putting a limit on the absolute error between the synchronized clock
  and the system clock. When a warp is detected, reset the EMA to force
  the clocks to resynchronize. Use the system clock until the EMA has
  stabalized again.
* synchronize system clock to hardware time
  Remove jitter from the system clock by synchronizing it to the change
  in hardware time stamps. This does not synchrnoize it in an absolute
  sense (i.e., doesn't remove system latench). However, coupled with
  calibrating system latency, this results in a stable, accurate clock.
* Add Travis config.
* Fixed linter errors.
* Contributors: C. Andy Martin, Rein Appeldoorn, Tony Baltovski

0.1.11 (2017-10-17)
-------------------
* Add support for URG-04LX in SCIP 1.1 mode
  The urg_node does not support SCIP 1.1. The Hokuyo URG-04LX supports both
  SCIP 1.1 and SCIP 2.0, but needs to be switched to SCIP 2.0 at every startup
  in its default configuration. For this purpose the function
  URGCWrapper::setToSCIP2() was added.
  A URG-04LX in SCIP 1.1 mode used to lead to an exception being thrown in
  URGCwrapper::initialize. Now, before throwing the exception an attempt to
  switch the sensor to SCIP 2.0 is made.
* Fixed comments in launch file and added roslaunch.
* Add flag to prevent updating of detailed status.
  If using a model that does not support AR00 command, hide it
  behind a rosparam.
* Add safety stop heading and distance values (`#28 <https://github.com/ros-drivers/urg_node/issues/28>`_)
  Added to the laser status field the last report of a safety
  stop of distance and angle reported. If this fails or is unavailable
  it will just report 0.
* Updating depend and roslint.
  Fixing some roslint error after moving a header name.
  Additionally fixing the gencfg to be on the lib and not the node.
* Adding missing std_srvs depend.
  Adding missing std_srvs depend to package.xml and CMakelists.txt
* Move urg_node to be a library.
  Moving urg_node to urg_node_driver as a library.
  This allows for other nodes to include this as an object instead
  of spawning another separate process.
* Add getAR00 status command.
  Added ability to pull the status of the lidar AR00 status command.
  This then publishes a latched topic with the current status of the
  lidar's error code and lockout status.
* Update urg_node to be a self contained class
  Updating urg node to be a self contained class. This allows
  for it to be imported in other nodes.
* Roslint
* Contributors: Benjamin Scholz, Mike O'Driscoll, Tony Baltovski
